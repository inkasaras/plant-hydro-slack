# plant-hydro-slack
Using a Raspberry Pi and a soil moisture sensor to send Slack notifications when our plant needs watering. This is based on [ModMyPi's code](https://www.modmypi.com/blog/raspberry-pi-plant-pot-moisture-sensor-with-email-notification-tutorial) but adapted to send Slack notifications instead.

## To do:
* Buy a moisture sensor for the Pi
* Check the code works
* Update this accordingly
